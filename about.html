                  HISTORY
                </h5>
                <p>
                  The initial activities we did were a series of photojournalism training led by Gordwin Odhiambo, a photographer and photojournalist born in Kibera,
                  Nairobi.
                </p>
                <p>'Having attended several workshops and masterclasses in storytelling, I wanted to share the knowledge I learned with the community who 
                  might not get opportunities to attend these trainings', Gordwin.
                </p>
                <p>With the space provided by the Human Needs Project Kibera, we've increased our activities 
                  around photography training in Kibera slums.
                <p>
                  In 2018, the first pioneer group (15 students) finished their basic and advanced 
                  classes partially sponsored by Nikon Kenya. Since then, we've been able to have more than 50 members from other creative fields always wanting 
                  to continue learning more.

                <p>
                  Located in Nairobi, Kenya 'Kibera' derived from a Nubian word meaning ‘forest’ or ‘jungle’, is Africa's biggest informal settlement.
                  Kibera is a vibrant but densely populated place. To survive, the majority of households rely on casual labor, such as washing clothes, to pay for rent, food, and other essentials
                  With the majority already living in extreme poverty.
                </p>
                  <p>Population growth and rural-urban migration fuelled by displacement caused by conflict, natural disasters, and climate change have meant an increase 
                    in population in the informal settlements. Further, the scarce resources available and shared among the huge population
                  exclude people living in the slums from urban opportunities.
